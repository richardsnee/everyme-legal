At Everyme, we take your privacy extremely seriously, from the design and functionality of our products to our content ownership structure and legal policies. You can trust that on Everyme, your privacy is taken care of to the best of our ability. However, as much as we would like to guarantee the privacy of your content in all scenarios, there are certain cases where we are not able to make such a claim. If you want true privacy, the best way for you to do this is to only share and provide your content and information to people that you trust and share your views on privacy. Everyme makes it as easy as possible for you to do that by giving you:
    
* Complete ownership of your data – modify, export, or delete anything of yours at any time, including your account if you want to.
* Control over who sees what. When you share in a private Circle, it will be visible only to the people within that Circle.
* A guarantee that we don’t track you and don’t sell your personal information or the content you share to advertisers or any other third party.

# Ownership
    
__SUMMARY__: You own and control your data. We don’t sell it to anybody and we don’t let any advertisers or anybody other than those who you share with see it.

Although we store the information you share with us on our servers for your convenience, the content you share belongs to you and is only visible to the people you have shared it with. You can modify or delete your personal information, manage your preferences, and export your data to your email at any time. You are also able to delete your account entirely from our databases and all of the data associated with it from within the application or by contacting help@everyme.com.

Because we do not own your data, we do not sell it to 3rd parties or advertisers. We may use your data to provide enhancements to your service by performing our own anonymous, computer-based analysis, such as providing an automatic summary of a link you share. We do not and will not provide data-mining tools to any 3rd parties nor do we allow any advertiser or third-party to see any of your data or the things you share, except as directed by you or in the limited circumstances disclosed to you in this policy.

# Privacy

__SUMMARY__: We do collect some personal information from you, but we only use it on our servers to do things like help you find your friends. We don’t reveal your phone numbers or email addresses to anyone. We may make your name, username, and avatar available on our user pages – but you can remove our access to do that as well. We display that information so that your friends can find your page easily and add you to a Circle. It is for your benefit. If Everyme was ever bought or sold by another company, they would need to abide by the rules in the Privacy Policy. Lastly, the only time we will ever give your information away is if we are required to comply with a law, regulation, or legal request. There are no services out there that don’t have this provision, and as much as we would love to deny legal requests on your behalf, we simply cannot.

We may collect personal information, such as your name, username, telephone number, and email address, when you sign up to use our site or application. We use your personal information for internal purposes only, such as to provide you with the site and application and to otherwise communicate with you about Everyme.

Other than basic information, including your name, avatar, and username, no personal information of yours is shared outside of the application unless you explicitly authorize it. You are able to opt-out of sharing even your basic information from within the application if you choose. Although we provide no option to share photos, messages, and other content in a public, search engine-indexable site, we do give you the option of sharing such content with email accounts and telephone numbers if you so choose. When content is shared with email accounts and telephone numbers, we can no longer guarantee its privacy, so we encourage you to be mindful of who you are sharing with on the application at all times.

Sometimes, we may access a third-party service provider, like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, to enhance your experience, with your permission and credentials that you have provided to us. You are able to remove those credentials and remove our access to those services. In such cases, your use of those services will be governed by their privacy policies and terms of service, and we cannot make a guarantee about what information they gather from use of their services.

We also contract with third-party service providers to host our servers and databases and to provide other services to us. We require our service providers to agree not to access or use any information or data they may have access to while providing services to Everyme other than as specified by us.

We also track statistics in aggregate across our site, in order to provide better quality of service, and we may sometimes share that data in aggregate. These statistics sometimes include your device's unique identification number, such as your UDID, but not attached to any personal information. We make use of third-party software to do so but we do not provide such third-party software providers with any of your personal information.

We also use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser) and/or Web beacons (a file placed on a website that monitors usage) to improve the experience of our site.  You can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

If Everyme is ever involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity, including your right to delete your account entirely from our databases and all of the data associated with it from within the application.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request or to protect the safety, property, or rights of Everyme or others. However, nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party or government request to disclose your information.

# Security

__SUMMARY__: Your data is transferred and stored securely to the best of our ability, however as with all stuff on the Internet, nothing is guaranteed so take caution.

We try our best to provide you with leading security practices, like encrypting all requests via a secure connection (HTTPS). However, no data transmission on the internet or on a network is 100% secure, so we cannot make a guarantee. Take care to manage access to the computers and devices where you are logged in to our application. 

# Changes

__SUMMARY__: When we change anything here, we make it easy for you to know what has changed on Github. If you have concerns about anything here, email us at legal@everyme.com.

From time-to-time, we need to make changes to our Privacy Policy to account for new features or for other reasons. When such changes occur, you are able to track them on Github as well as view the new document on our site. By continuing to use our service, you are consenting to the revised policy. If you have concerns about our policy, please forward them to legal@everyme.com and we'll do our best to respond promptly.
